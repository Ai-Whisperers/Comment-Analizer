### **🔍 Anti-Token Loss Navigation Protocol:**

#### **Rule 1: Always Start with Graph Context**
```bash
# NEVER search blindly through files
# ALWAYS use hierarchical graph navigation

Before Debugging:
1. Identify issue category (Performance, Config, Integration, Security)
2. Navigate: Master Graph → Relevant Level → Specific Component
3. Use: Documented sub-graph context for precise location
4. Apply: Issue location map for direct file navigation
```

#### **Rule 2: Preserve Component Relationship Context**
```bash
# NEVER debug components in isolation  
# ALWAYS understand integration relationships

Component Context Protocol:
1. Current component analysis using sub-graph documentation
2. Related component identification using graph relationships
3. Integration point analysis using cross-sub-graph mapping
4. Impact propagation analysis using architectural layer understanding
```

#### **Rule 3: Leverage Issue Correlation Matrix**
```bash
# NEVER treat issues as isolated problems
# ALWAYS consider issue cascade relationships

Issue Correlation Protocol:
1. Primary issue identification using issue location map
2. Secondary issue correlation using cascade analysis  
3. Root cause analysis using graph-level understanding
4. Solution impact analysis using complete system context
```
